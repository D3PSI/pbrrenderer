This repository contains my first ever physically-based rendering application, 
written in C++-17 using the OpenGL core version 3.3 for backwards compatibility.  

## Installation

### Linux

The repository comes with a versatile install script. It offers support for a wide variety of distributions including Debian, Fedora and Arch/Manjaro Linux. Clone the repository and run the installer like so:

    git clone https://github.com/D3PSI/pbrrenderer.git
    cd pbrrenderer/

Start the installation procedure via one of the following commands:

1.:

    ./INSTALL.sh

2.: 

    make install

Then, run the application with `./pbr` in the project root directory.
If you want to recompile and automatically run the software, run either `make run` or `make debug`.

### Windows

Windows is currently not supported. Support will be added in future versions.

### macOS

macOS is currently not supported. Support may be added in future versions.

## Uninstallation

Run the integrated uninstaller like this:

    ./UNINSTALL.sh

It takes care of removing shortcuts and files generated by the installer.

## Getting started

At the moment, there is no documentation as this project is still early in development.
 Here is the base program being used in the repository for testing:

    /**

     *  Please refer to LICENSE.md for further information
     * 
     *  Refer to README.md for installation and compilation instructions
     */
    #include "pbr/PBR.hpp"

    /**
     * Serves as a keyboard input callback function for the PBR core engine
     * @param _window A pointer to the GLFWwindow
     */
    void keyboardInputCallback(GLFWwindow* _window) {
        if(glfwGetKey(_window, GLFW_KEY_SPACE) == GLFW_PRESS)
            std::cout << "This is an example on how you can define own key actions.\n";
    }

    /**
     *  Defines the main entry point for the application
     */
    int main() {
        pbr::pbrInit();
        pbr::pbrTitle("PBR by D3PSI");
        pbr::pbrSize(1280, 720);
        pbr::pbrLoadingScreenImage("res/images/lion.png");
        pbr::pbrApplicationIcon("res/images/lion-cropped.png");
        pbr::pbrDisplayMode(pbr::util::flags::PBR_WINDOWED);
        pbr::pbrKeyboardInputCallback(keyboardInputCallback);
        return pbr::pbrExecute();
    }

## Troubleshoot

### Linux

#### Fedora
If you are facing the problem that `libassimp.so.5` isn't found anywhere.

    ./pbr: error while loading shared libraries: libassimp.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Then just simply make a copy of `libassimp.so.3` or any other version and rename it to `libassimp.so.5` in the specific folder.
    
    sudo cp /usr/lib64/libassimp.so.3 /usr/lib64/libassimp.so.5
    
Like this.

This is also an problem with the boost library for `libboost_filesystem.so.1.71.0` and `libboost_system.so.1.71.0` and should be solved this way:

    sudo cp /usr/lib64/libboost_filesystem.so /usr/lib64/libboost_filesystem.so.1.71.0
    sudo cp /usr/lib64/libboost_system.so /usr/lib64/libboost_system.so.1.71.0
